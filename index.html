Nobody knows how many of them are there but the legend says that around 10 000 lions are still alive and guard mysterious treasures that none of the living people have yet been  able to see.</p>
                                    <p class="tales-top__par">No one knows exactly when the lions appeared and where their kingdom is. Rumor says that many thousands of years ago, on the planet whose name has been lost in history; <span>robots seized power and destroyed everything alive.</span> </p>
                                    <p class="tales-top__par">The last King before his death managed to program the computer to create an <span>army of lions-defenders to protect the kingdom</span>, but it was already too late, all of the humans have already been destroyed...</p>
                                    <p class="tales-top__par">Computers generated 10,000 unique lions-guards who defeated the villains and protected the treasures of the kingdom. The war lasted for thousands of years and there was peace. Evil robots were ruined, and lions became the only inhabitants of the planet. Gradually, the lions found all the secret treasures that the king guarded and in his honor began to wear them on themselves.</p>

                                <p>This lion kind does know how to have fun. Every weekend he hangs out in the best night clubs of the lions kingdom. He is very social, there is no rumor that he hasn’t heard. He loves techno music and doesn’t mind to mix a few tracks himself. Most time of the year you can meet this lion on some viby beaches
                                    he knows everyone in the yard and he is as well a big female lover and fashion expert.

                                <p>How can u define this lion from others? That is a very easy question. This lion most likely gonna wear a hat with some fun prints, has something like a joint in his mouth and wears some dope glasses.

                                </p>
                                <p>But don’t let his look to fool you. Years and years ago lions of exactly this kind were scouts who learned all the enemies secrets first and used to be Kings personal Assassins. They were cunning and merciless spies. Only the smartest and strongest lions could get into their squads.
